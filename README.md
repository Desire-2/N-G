### 1.1. Background and Problem Statement

Wetlands are crucial ecosystems that support a wide variety of flora and fauna, particularly wetland-dependent birds which rely on these habitats for breeding, foraging, and shelter. In Rwanda, the Rwasave wetland in the Huye district is a significant site for these birds, providing essential resources and habitat structures. However, these ecosystems are under increasing pressure from human activities, leading to habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity.

One major issue in the Rwasave wetland is the conflict between agricultural activities and bird conservation. Farmers in the area frequently chase away birds to protect their rice crops and fish ponds. This practice disrupts the natural behavior and habitat use of the birds, potentially leading to declines in bird populations and affecting the overall health of the wetland ecosystem. The presence of protectors at fish ponds specifically targeting fish-eating birds adds another layer of disturbance, further stressing the avian community.

The ecological value of wetland-dependent birds extends beyond their roles as individual species. These birds are often considered indicators of wetland health due to their sensitivity to changes in the environment. By studying these birds, researchers can gain insights into the broader ecological condition of wetlands and identify areas in need of conservation and management efforts.

Given these challenges, this research aims to thoroughly assess the ecology of wetland-dependent birds in the Rwasave wetland. By understanding species diversity, abundance, and distribution, as well as identifying key indicator species, we can develop informed conservation strategies. This will not only help protect bird populations but also enhance the overall ecological integrity of the wetland, benefiting a wide range of species and ecosystem services【9†source】【11†source】【12†source】.

### 1.3. Literature Review

#### Assessing Species Diversity, Abundance, and Distribution

Wetlands provide critical habitats for a diverse array of bird species. The assessment of species diversity, abundance, and distribution is fundamental for understanding the ecological dynamics of wetland ecosystems. Studies by Gibbons (1997) and others have shown that wetlands support high levels of bird diversity due to their complex habitat structures and abundant food resources【11†source】. Species diversity indices, such as the Shannon-Weaver index, are commonly used to quantify biodiversity in these habitats【12†source】. For instance, research on Ethiopian wetlands demonstrated that seasonal variations significantly impact bird species richness and abundance, reflecting the dynamic nature of wetland ecosystems【12†source】.

In Rwanda, the Rwasave wetland serves as a crucial site for various wetland-dependent birds. Previous studies in similar African wetlands highlight the importance of considering both spatial and temporal factors when assessing bird populations. These studies indicate that bird communities in wetlands are influenced by habitat heterogeneity, water availability, and human disturbances【10†source】【11†source】. Therefore, a comprehensive survey of the Rwasave wetland is essential to capture the full extent of its avian biodiversity and the factors affecting it.

#### Evaluating Habitat Preferences, Foraging Behaviors, and Activities

Understanding habitat preferences and foraging behaviors of wetland birds is critical for their conservation. Wetland birds exhibit a range of adaptations to exploit the unique resources available in these habitats. Research has shown that factors such as vegetation type, water depth, and prey availability play significant roles in shaping bird habitat use and foraging strategies【11†source】. For example, wading birds may prefer shallow waters with abundant invertebrates, while diving birds are more dependent on deeper water bodies with fish【11†source】.

Behavioral studies, such as those conducted in European and North American wetlands, reveal that wetland birds' foraging activities are closely linked to their morphological and physiological traits【11†source】. By observing these behaviors in the Rwasave wetland, we can gain insights into how different species utilize the habitat and identify critical resources necessary for their survival. This information is vital for developing targeted conservation measures that addre### 1.3. Literature Review

#### Assessing Species Diversity, Abundance, and Distribution

Wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems on Earth, supporting a wide array of biodiversity, particularly avian species. The assessment of species diversity, abundance, and distribution in wetland ecosystems is essential for understanding their ecological dynamics and for conservation planning. Studies have shown that wetlands support high bird diversity due to their complex habitat structures and abundant food resources【9†source】【10†source】【11†source】. The use of species diversity indices, such as the Shannon-Weaver index, is standard in quantifying biodiversity in these environments【12†source】. For example, in Ethiopian wetlands, researchers found significant seasonal variations in bird species richness and abundance, underscoring the dynamic nature of wetland ecosystems【12†source】.

In Rwanda, the Rwasave wetland is a critical site for numerous wetland-dependent birds. Similar studies in African wetlands highlight the need to consider spatial and temporal factors when assessing bird populations. These studies suggest that bird communities in wetlands are influenced by habitat heterogeneity, water availability, and human disturbances such as agriculture and fishing【10†source】【11†source】【12†source】. A comprehensive survey of the Rwasave wetland is therefore crucial to understand its avian biodiversity and the factors affecting it. Such an assessment will provide baseline data necessary for effective conservation and management strategies.

Behavioral studies in European and North American wetlands have shown that foraging activities are closely linked to the morphological and physiological traits of wetland birds【11†source】. Observing these behaviors in the Rwasave wetland will provide insights into how different species utilize the habitat and identify critical resources necessary for their survival. This information is crucial for developing conservation measures that address the specific needs of these birds. Additionally, understanding these behaviors can help mitigate conflicts with local farmers and fish pond protectors, who often chase birds away to protect their crops and fish stocks【9†source】【11†source】.

#### Identifying Indicator Species and Their Roles in Habitat Monitoring

Indicator species are organisms that reflect specific environmental conditions, and wetland-dependent birds are often used as indicators due to their sensitivity to changes in habitat quality and water levels【9†source】【12†source】. Selecting appropriate indicator species involves understanding their ecological roles and their responses to environmental stresses.

Research has shown that birds such as herons, egrets, and certain species of waterfowl are effective indicators of wetland health【12†source】. These species are typically easy to monitor and provide valuable information about the ecosystem's status. For instance, a decline in fish-eating bird populations might indicate problems with water quality or fish stocks, while changes in the abundance of insectivorous birds could signal shifts in insect populations due to pollution or climate change【10†source】.

In the context of the Rwasave wetland, identifying and monitoring indicator species will enable continuous assessment of habitat conditions and inform management practices aimed at maintaining or improving ecological integrity. Previous studies in African wetlands have successfully used bird populations as bioindicators to monitor ecosystem health and guide conservation efforts【10†source】【12†source】.

Overall, the literature emphasizes the importance of comprehensive ecological assessments in wetland habitats. By focusing on species diversity, habitat preferences, and indicator species, this research will contribute valuable knowledge to the conservation and management of the Rwasave wetland and similar ecosystems globally. This understanding is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, preserve biodiversity, and maintain the ecological functions of wetlands【9†source】【10†source】【11†source】【12†source】.
